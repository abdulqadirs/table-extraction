# Deep Splitting and Merging for Table Structure Decomposition

## Data Labelling
Install the [T-Truth ](https://github.com/sohaib023/T-Truth "T-Truth ")labelling tool for labelling the rows and columns of tables in document images.

## Data Preprocessing
The row and column separator generated by T-Truth tool are few pixel wide. For training the split model we need to maximize the with of row column separators without intersecting any table cell content.
